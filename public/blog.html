          <h2>Revocation</h2>
          <p>We code every day.  Which is interesting.  It gets quiet and kind of empty.  The room buzzes and there is a lilting crescendo of sound.  Chirp buzz chirp.  The keyboards talk more than anything.  Clip, click chirp.  Sometimes it is staccato.  Tap, tap tap taptaptap.   Running quickly through the keys the sound of the empty room filled with something more than sound.  Something deeper happening but not expressed.  Each keystroke a grain, gathered into piles.  Swept under the rug.  Filling boxes, buckets, every container that was empty now full, sand spilling on the floor, gathering in the corners.</p>

          <p>Sometimes there are breaks.  We stand and talk about our feelings, which seems to bother people for some reason.  Why do our feelings matter, why do we have to feel good about what we are doing? Can’t we just code, get on with it.  Move forward and follow directions like good little ants.  There is a factory setting here</p>

          <p>Problem solving is fun.  The little bits that you miss.  An e instead of an i, a semi-colon, and random missing parenthesis.  How long do you search for that missing bracket before you give up, how much frustration is too much frustration.  Do you run with it or do you let it devour you.  Do you find it enlightening or destructive.  As we move farther and deeper into the understanding of the jargon laced context of the world we have chosen to inhabit.  Is it easier to forgot those things or let them be a part of the global scope, that context in which you live.</p>

          <p>Most days eventually you get tired of all the shining pixels.  The sand lifts off the floor and settles in the corner of your eyes, it grinds down, it filters into your hands it glitters and slides against the ends of your fingertips and all you want to do is go outside, breath in the sunshine fluttered air and climb up higher than the building you’ve been trapped in all day, and yell at the top of your lungs.</p>
